# Intel-hackathon

#### Team Name - SK
#### Problem Statement - Diabetes, if left undiagnosed until later stages, becomes incurable. The delayed diagnosis of diabetes poses significant challenges in healthcare, as many individuals fail to recognize symptoms, leading to delayed treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods may miss cases due to the disease's complexity.By empowering early detection and intervention, we aim to enhance health outcomes. Utilising Big Data Analytics & Machine Learning in order to predict the risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 based on clinical parameters. This enables early detection of diabetes, eliminating the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. 

## A Brief Description of the Prototype: 

Big Data Analytics is pivotal in the healthcare sector, offering significant contributions. By harnessing its power, one can delve into vast datasets, uncovering concealed insights and patterns to unearth valuable knowledge. Machine Learning emerges as a crucial tool within this framework, facilitating the prediction of outcomes with precision. Moreover, it enables the development of sophisticated algorithms capable of analyzing complex healthcare data, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes and improving patient care. 

In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths.

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

In hospitals, current method to detect diabetes is to collect blood samples and conduct Fasting, Postprandial and HbA1c glucose level tests. To supplement them and predict the risk of diabetes beforehand, we are using Big Data Analytics & ML to predict the risk of diabetes based on certain clinical parameters like Blood glucose levels, BMI, Insulin concentration, Comorbidities etc.
